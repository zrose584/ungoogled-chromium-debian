  * The master_preferences files has been moved from /usr/share/chromium to
    /etc/chromium to support system level configuration of default options.

chromium-browser (69.0.3497.100-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * All local extensions that are installed to /usr/share/chromium/extensions
    will now be loaded and enabled automatically.
  * Some extension packages used to do this manually with a file in
    /etc/chromium.d. This conflicts with the new approach, so those packages
    need to be updated to account for this.
  * External extensions were enabled by default in an upload prior to the
    release of stretch and will remain this way for the buster release.  A
    future upload following the release of buster will disable this.

chromium-browser (55.0.2883.75-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * External extensions are now disabled by default.  Chromium will only load
    extensions that are explicitly specified with the --load-extension command
    line option passed into CHROMIUM_FLAGS.  See the chromium-lwn4chrome
    package for an example of how to do this.
  * You can also use the --enable-remote-extensions command line argument to
    chromium, which will bypass this restriction.
